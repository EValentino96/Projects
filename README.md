# Projects
Showcasing various projects related to data science, data engineering and data analysis.

I know I'm lacking in physical work experience but it doesn't mean I'm lacking in skills or talent, and this is where I wish to showcase said skills and talent. I'm trying to pick the most relavent topics (such as finance, healthcare and social trends) and grabbing as raw data as I can from APIs or Kaggle.

To start I will be doing a fiance related project where I build a stock price trend analysis and prediction model.
I'll be working with Nvidia stock, I chose this for two reasons: 
1) My husband works at Nvidia and I thought it would be cool to see how the stock has been doing and where my model predicts it will go and if I'm accurate.
2) It's a moderately volatile stock, which means it has strong price movement but not completely erratic and it's a highly relatvant topic today due to its AI and GPUs.
   
This project will showcase a number of skills such as:
- Fetching historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage, Finnhub or Polygon.io.
- Performing time-series analysis (moving averages, volatility measures).
- Implementing a simple forecasting model (ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTMs for advanced ML).
- Visualizing trends using interactive dashboards (Streamlit, Plotly, or Tableau).
  
Step 1: Data Collection & Exploration
- Use the Yahoo Finance API or Alpha Vantage API to fetch historical Nvidia stock data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Price trends over time
  - Moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day)
  - Trading volume impact
    - Visualize with Matplotlib/Seaborn to understand patterns.

Step 2: Feature Engineering & Modeling
- Create new features:
  - Technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands)
  - Market factors (S&P 500 index correlation, news sentiment if possible)
    - Build prediction models:
  - Baseline: Linear Regression
  - Intermediate: ARIMA or Prophet (time-series forecasting)
  - Advanced: LSTMs (deep learning for sequential data)
    
Step 3: Refinement & Presentation
- Compare model performances and optimize for accuracy.
- Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit, Plotly, or Tableau).
- Write a portfolio-ready project summary:
  - Problem statement
  - Key findings
  - Model performance
  - Business insights
